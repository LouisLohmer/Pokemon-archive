# Pokemon-archive
## About the project
This **JavaScript-project** is a selfmade and of course minimalistic Pokemon-archive/Pokedex. By fetching data from the Poke-API, in total 1023 Pokemon each in a seperate preview container, is loaded onto the frontend with an images and it's name. 
You are also able to see the details of each pokemon regarding attacks, abilities, weigth and more. A filter is also avaible, if only specific pokemon should be displayed. Keep in mind that text in the frontend is written in german, since i'am a german developer.

## Enable and able darkmode and whitemode
By clicking on the slider in the top-right corner of the Pokedex, you can enable darkmode. The frontend then will transition into a more darker colorway. If it's in darkmode and you want it be in whitemode again, just click the slider again and the frontend will have a more colorful and white colorway again

## Display pokemon-details
Each Pokemon has it's own preview container, which contains a name, a pixelart-image and it's number in the pokedex. By hovering over the image, your cursor will turn into a pointer and by clicking it, a popup-Window will display the pokemondetails.
To close the popup-Window, use the close-Button in the top-left corner, which looks like an X.
