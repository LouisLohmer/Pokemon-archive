# Pokemon-archive
## About the project
This **JavaScript-project** is a selfmade and of course minimalistic Pokemon-archive/Pokedex. By fetching data from the Poke-API, in total 1023 Pokemon each in a seperate preview container, is loaded onto the frontend with an images and it's name. 
You are also able to see the details of each pokemon regarding attacks, abilities, weigth and more. A filter is also avaible, if only specific pokemon should be diplayed. Keep in mind that text in the frontend is written in german, since i'am a german developer.

## Enable and able darkmode and whitemode
By clicking on the slider in the top-right corner of the Pokedex, you can enable darkmode. The frontend then will transition into a more darker colorway. If it's in darkmode and you want it be in whitemode again, just click the slider again and the frontend will have a more colorful and white colorway again
